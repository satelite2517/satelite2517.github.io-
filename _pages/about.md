Hello! I'm __Sun jae Lee__, a undergraduate school student majoring in __Physics__ and __Computer science & engineering__ at Seoul National University. I'm interested in fusion plasma, especially in HPC and ML/DL in fusion.

I'm always open to new opportunities for learning and collaboration, so feel free to reach out if you share similar interests or have exciting projects in mind! If you are interested you can check out my recent works.
